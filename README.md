# Milkywire_Photoshare

A photo sharing web application for the Assignment at Milkywire.  I tried to do my best but I couldn't get it running as 
there are some more issues to be fixed.  

Frontend: `React` + `Redux` + `MaterialUI`

Backend: `Node.js` + `Express` + `MongoDB`

### Getting Start

```
$ git clone https://github.com/karthikselva19/Milkywire_Photoshare
.git
```
```
$ yarn install
```
```
$ cd Milkywire_Photoshare
/Web_App 
```
```
$ yarn start
```
And open another terminal panel

```
$ cd Milkywire_Photoshare
/server
```
```
$ yarn start
```

You should see the application running at `http://localhost:3000/`
